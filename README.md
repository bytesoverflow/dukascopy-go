## ⚡ Why `dukascopy-go`?

Compared to Node.js or Python alternatives (like `dukascopy-node`), `dukascopy-go` is built for **speed, scale, and extreme reliability**.

| Feature | `dukascopy-go` | Node.js Alternatives |
|---|---|---|
| **Speed** | 🚀 Native Go + 64KB Sequential Buffering (~100x Faster) | 🐢 Slower V8/Node.js execution |
| **Parities (Assets)**| 🌍 **170+ Offline Fallback database** + Online Catalog Hot-Reloading | ⚠️ Requires full online resolution |
| **Multi-Symbol** | ✅ Comma-separated list with automatic path formatting | ❌ Single symbol only |
| **Dependencies** | ✨ Zero (Standalone single binary) | 📦 Requires Node.js, NPM, and modules |
| **Delta Sync** | ✅ In-place sync to append missing slices | ❌ Restarts from scratch |
| **Gap Filling** | ✅ Quant-grade forward-filling during market open hours | ❌ Messer gap data left as-is |
| **Throttling** | ✅ AIMD Token-Bucket Adaptive Throttling (handles 429) | ❌ Standard fixed rate limits |
| **Resumability** | ✅ Automatic manifest checkpoints & auto-resume | ❌ Often restarts from scratch |
| **Real-time Stream**| ✅ Native WebSocket & Stdout (JSONL/CSV) | ⚠️ Node.js API only |
| **SDK Support** | ✅ Public importable `pkg/`, Go library, Python wrapper | ⚠️ Node.js only |
| **Deduplication** | ✅ In-place atomic duplicate/gap repair | ❌ Often requires Pandas/external tools |

## 🚀 Installation

You don't need Go installed to run the pre-built binaries. Just grab the latest `.exe`, macOS binary, or Linux binary from the **[Releases page](https://github.com/Nosvemos/dukascopy-go/releases)**.

If you have **Go 1.22+**, you can install or run it directly:

```bash
# Install globally
go install github.com/Nosvemos/dukascopy-go/cmd/dukascopy-go@latest

# Or run without installing
go run github.com/Nosvemos/dukascopy-go/cmd/dukascopy-go@latest --help

# Build from source
go build -o dukascopy-go ./cmd/dukascopy-go
```

---

## 📖 Quick Start

### 🪄 Interactive Wizard (Zero Config!)
Don't want to learn CLI flags? Just run the binary without arguments to launch the **Interactive Setup Wizard**:
```bash
dukascopy-go
```

### 🔍 Find Instruments (170+ Supported!)
Search for a specific instrument, or list them all. Supports live catalog hot-reloading:
```bash
# Search for Turkish Lira crosses
dukascopy-go instruments --query try

# Lists all available instruments (showing up to 20 by default)
dukascopy-go instruments

# Force hot-reload instruments cache online and show ALL 170+ parities
dukascopy-go instruments --limit 0 --update
```

### 📉 Download Historical Data
Download 1-minute gold bars to CSV using a **flexible duration** (`--last 30d`) or exact dates:
```bash
# Download the last 30 days of 1-minute data
dukascopy-go download --symbol xauusd --timeframe m1 --last 30d --output ./data/xauusd-m1.csv

# Multi-symbol batch downloading to directory
dukascopy-go download --symbol EUR/USD,GBP/USD,BTC/USD --timeframe d1 --last 1y --output ./data/
```

**Need a massive dataset?** Use parallel downloading and Parquet output:
```bash
dukascopy-go download \
  --symbol xauusd \
  --timeframe m1 \
  --from 2020-01-01 \
  --to 2024-01-01 \
  --output ./data/xauusd.parquet \
  --partition auto \
  --parallelism 8
```

## 💎 Elite Quant Enhancements

### 🔄 In-Place Smart Delta Sync (`sync`)
Keep your downloaded historical files completely up to date in-place with zero duplicate or out-of-order records:
```bash
dukascopy-go sync --symbol EUR/USD --output ./data/eur_usd.csv
```
The sync command inspects the target file, extracts the last written timestamp, and automatically queries the missing slices up to the present moment, appending them in-place safely.

### 📊 Quant-Grade Gap Filling (`--fill-gaps`)
Unexpected liquidity gaps can corrupt backtesting results. Enable smart forward-filling to keep timeframe intervals uniform:
```bash
dukascopy-go download --symbol EUR/USD --timeframe m1 --last 7d --output ./data/eur_usd.csv --fill-gaps forward
```
- **Forward-Fill Loop**: Missing bars are forward-filled with the previous Close price and Volume `0`.
- **Weekend Filter**: Weekends and holiday closures are automatically detected and skipped to avoid injecting synthetic bars during expected market closures.

### 🛡️ Token-Bucket Adaptive Throttling
We designed a highly resilient AIMD-based (Additive Increase / Multiplicative Decrease) rate limiting system that self-corrects based on response status codes:
- **Instant Backoff**: If hit with `429 Too Many Requests`, the adaptive rate limit instantly doubles (up to `5s`) to completely clear connection queues.
- **Slow Recovery**: On successful requests, it slowly decreases the delay by `10ms` per response back to your defined base rate limit.

## 🐹 Go Library SDK (Public `pkg/`)

Since `dukascopy-go` places its core client and CSV exporter packages under the public `pkg/` folder, you can seamlessly import them as a library in your own Go applications!

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"time"

	"github.com/Nosvemos/dukascopy-go/pkg/dukascopy"
)

func main() {
	// Initialize the public SDK client
	client := dukascopy.NewClient("https://jetta.dukascopy.com", 30*time.Second)

	req := dukascopy.DownloadRequest{
		Symbol:      "EUR/USD",
		Granularity: dukascopy.GranularityD1,
		Side:        dukascopy.PriceSideBid,
		From:        time.Now().AddDate(0, 0, -5),
		To:          time.Now(),
	}

	result, err := client.Download(context.Background(), req)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	fmt.Printf("Downloaded %d bars for symbol: %s\n", len(result.Bars), result.Instrument.Name)
	for _, bar := range result.Bars {
		fmt.Printf("Time: %s, Open: %f, Close: %f\n", bar.Time, bar.Open, bar.Close)
	}
}
```

## 💻 Python & C SDK 

Not using the CLI? `dukascopy-go` compiles to a C shared library (`.so`, `.dll`, `.dylib`) which can be wrapped in almost any language. We provide a **Python `ctypes` SDK** out of the box!

```python
from sdk.python.dukascopy import DukascopyClient

client = DukascopyClient()
bars = client.download_bars('eurusd', 'm1', '2024-01-01T00:00:00Z', '2024-01-02T00:00:00Z')
print(bars)
```
*(Check the `sdk/python` directory for full usage examples)*
